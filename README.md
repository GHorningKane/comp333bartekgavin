# comp333bartekgavin
Homework 1 repository :). effective-pancake

Teammates: Ian, Bartek, Gavin

Purpose of the code: Display a mock landing page for a music discussion site :). 

Repo contents: Some images (album covers), index.html (our website), style-sheet.css, sign-in.html, what da dog doing.gif which is an image for another site, dog-chilling.html, also in the repo, which we post in as an iframe, and a license file. And of course the readme, but you already know that :p.

How to run the file: 
https://ghorningkane.github.io/comp333ianbartekgavin/
is the link to our website from the repo, otherwise download the repo, and open index.html in a browser. 

Work split was even :). We did have a lot of issues with github version control though haha, we got it worked out in the end.

# User can only rate once:
The same user does not have the ability to enter the same entry twice without seeing this error

# Users must have a login, no duplicate users are allowed, and users stay logged in:
In the instance someone attempts to sign up with a duplicate user they are met with this error

# The registration asks for users to enter their passwords twice to ensure correctness:

# If a user requests the registration page, they are redirected to the list of rated songs:

# At the top of each page the current user is displayed:

# All ratings are visable for all, but only interractable for those who created the rating:

# Updating/Deleting/Canceling brings one back to the list of ratings:

# Via the frontend requisites are present:
Users cannot leave fields blank:
Users cannot make a password smaller than 10 characters long:
Users cannot rate with more than one integer:

# SQL Querries are parameterized to avoid injections attacks:

# Passwords are hashed:

Our Work was split evenly once again!
